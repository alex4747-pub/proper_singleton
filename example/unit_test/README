Example of the proper singleton for
unit testing.

1. We test the network driver.
2. We link in the mock chipset driver with low
   level number so it get instantiated.
3. We configure the behavior of the mock
   chipset driver (aka outcome).
4. A mock chipset driver instance is created
   in SetUp and destroyed in TearDown.
